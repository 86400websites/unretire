# Error Tracking Guide — How Problems Get Caught, Fixed, and Closed

Written for the owner. Your job in this system is never to read a log — you read plain English and make three decisions: how urgent, approve the fix, send the user message.

---

## 1. What Sentry is

A black-box recorder for the website. Claude Code installs it once (free account, one key). From then on, whenever an error happens to a real user — on any page, any device — Sentry records: **who** it was (their account email if they're logged in), **which page**, **which device and browser**, **what the error said**, and **their last few clicks** before it broke. Then it emails you.

What that means in practice: when a member writes "the site broke when I tried to open my course," you don't ask them twenty questions. Their answer is already recorded.

## 2. The two doors in

**Door A — Sentry finds it first (most cases).** You get an alert email, often before any user has noticed or bothered to complain. Forward it to Claude Code or say: *"/handle-error — new Sentry alert, here's the link."*

**Door B — a user reports it.** Someone emails or messages: payment failed, can't log in, something looks broken. You paste their message plus their email address: *"/handle-error — [user's email] reported this: [their message]."* Claude Code looks that user up in Sentry and the other logs and reconstructs what happened to them.

Either way, you get back **one plain paragraph**: what actually happened, who was affected (this one user / some users / everyone), whether it's a bug at all, and a proposed severity.

## 3. The lane — every incident, both doors, same five steps

1. **Understand.** Claude Code investigates and explains in plain words. If the logs show nothing, it reproduces the problem in a real browser before concluding anything. "Couldn't find the cause" is a status, never a conclusion.
2. **Decide severity.** This is the brake that keeps the system from exhausting you — not everything is a fire drill:

   | Severity | Means | You respond |
   |---|---|---|
   | **Blocker** | Money, login, or the whole site is affected | Fix **today**. If the site is truly down or losing data, `docs/ROLLBACK.md` first, fix second |
   | **High** | A real feature broken for some users | Fix sprint **this week** |
   | **Medium** | Annoying, but everything works | Post-launch backlog, next sprint |
   | **Low** | Cosmetic | Backlog |

3. **Fix.** A normal bug-fix sprint — branch → PR → Preview → review → merge. Nothing new to learn.
4. **A new test, always.** The fix isn't done until a test exists that reproduces this exact bug — it fails on the broken version, passes on the fixed one, and joins the launch-gate suite forever (and the morning check, if it's critical). This is the rule that makes the whole system compound: **the same bug can never quietly come back**, and every incident permanently strengthens the site.
5. **Tell the user, close the log.** Sentry shows exactly who was hit, so you message exactly those people using `templates/USER-UPDATE-TEMPLATE.md`. The incident's row in `docs/INCIDENT-LOG.md` cannot be marked Closed until "user informed" is ticked (or "n/a — caught before any user was affected" is recorded). The loop always ends with a human hearing from you — that's how a bug becomes a trust moment instead of a churn moment.

## 4. What Sentry can't see — and who covers it

Sentry catches things that **crash**. Some failures are silent: the email that never arrived, the button that did nothing, the form that "succeeded" into a void. Nothing crashed, so Sentry has nothing. That's why `/handle-error` also checks the **Stripe dashboard** (payments), the **email provider's logs** (deliveries), the **Vercel logs** (the server), and the **database logs** — and why the morning check (testing-setup) re-runs the critical journeys every day. Between them, both kinds of breakage are covered. You never need to know which log holds the answer; that's the skill's job.

## 5. "Payment failed" — read this before ever panicking

Most failed payments are **not bugs**. Cards get declined, banks block foreign or online charges, people abandon the bank-verification screen. All normal, all visible in Stripe, none of it your site's fault. The skill will tell you plainly which case you're in:

- *"Her card was declined by her bank — not a bug. Suggest she retries or uses another card."* → send the payment-helper message from the user-update template. Done, logged, closed.
- *"The checkout itself is erroring for everyone — Blocker."* → the lane, at today-speed.

The distinction saves you from panicking over routine declines and from shrugging off real breakage.

## 6. Access denied — sometimes the system working

"I can't get in" is occasionally the security doing its job (not a member, subscription lapsed, wrong account). The skill checks whether the denial was *correct* before treating it as a bug. If it's correct, the user message explains their actual status kindly — that's support, not a fix.

## 7. Privacy, in one paragraph

Sentry stores technical details plus the user's account identifier so you can help them — never passwords, never card numbers (Stripe never exposes those to the site at all). Claude Code configures Sentry to scrub sensitive fields during setup. When you paste a user's report into `/handle-error`, their email is enough — never ask users for passwords, and never paste one anywhere.

## 8. Your weekly five minutes

Open `docs/INCIDENT-LOG.md`. Every row should be moving toward Closed, every Closed row has its new test and its "user informed ✓". Repeating patterns (three incidents on the same form) → ask Claude Code whether something deeper needs a sprint. That's the whole job.

Next step → `SETUP-CHECKLIST.md`. It ends with a deliberate test error, so the first alert you ever receive is one you were expecting.
